# Machine Learning Modules

This directory contains the Python modules for the machine learning functionality of the LLM training workflow.

## Structure

- `preprocessing`: Modules for data preprocessing, tokenization, and dataset preparation
- `models`: Model architecture definitions and implementations
- `training`: Training loop implementations, optimizers, and learning rate schedulers
- `evaluation`: Evaluation metrics and model performance analysis
- `inference`: Text generation, beam search, and inference optimizations

## Usage

Each module is designed to be used both programmatically and through the UI. The modules expose their functionality through a simple API that can be called from the JavaScript frontend.
