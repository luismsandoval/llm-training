1. **Environment Setup**  
   - **Task Name:** Installing Required Dependencies  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Install Node.js and npm on the development machine (if not already installed).  
       2. Initialize a new project and install Storybook by running `npx sb init`, which sets up the Storybook environment.  
       3. Install machine learning framework libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. If the LLM training will run in a Python environment, ensure those are installed in that environment; if using JavaScript/Node for training, add any necessary ML packages (or their JavaScript equivalents like TensorFlow.js) via npm.  
       4. Install any additional utilities (e.g., data processing libraries or Storybook addons) that might be needed for the LLM workflow.  
       5. Verify all installations by running Storybook (`npm run storybook`) to confirm it starts, and checking that PyTorch/TensorFlow are accessible (e.g., import them in a test script to confirm no errors).  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       This task does not require application data or UI state. It only needs access to the internet or package repositories to download dependencies and system permission to install them. No Storybook component state is involved (it’s an environment configuration step).  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       None. This is a foundational setup task and should be completed before any Storybook components or LLM training features are implemented.  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** Command-line instructions and installer files (e.g., running shell commands like `npm install`, executing Node.js installer).  
       **Output:** A development environment with Node.js, Storybook, and ML frameworks installed. The output is verified by successful execution of Storybook and the ability to import/use ML libraries without errors (no user-facing data format output, just the environment state).  

   - **Task Name:** Configuring Storybook.js for LLM Training Workflow  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Update Storybook configuration files (such as `.storybook/main.js`) to include paths for the LLM training components. For example, set up Storybook to load stories from a `src/components` or `src/stories` directory where LLM workflow components will reside.  
       2. Add necessary Storybook addons to support the workflow. This may include addons like **Controls** (for adjusting props/state via UI), **Actions** (to log events like training start/stop), or any custom addon needed for bridging to the training backend. Install and register these addons in `.storybook/main.js` or `.storybook/manager.js` as needed.  
       3. If the LLM training will use static assets (such as dataset files or model files), configure Storybook to serve static files by modifying `main.js` (e.g., using `staticDirs` to point to a `public` or `datasets` directory).  
       4. Adjust Webpack configuration if required: for instance, if using a web-worker or external script for training, ensure the build can handle it. This could involve adding a rule to load worker scripts or configuring environment variables for the training process.  
       5. Organize Storybook’s UI for clarity: group related stories into sections (for example, a “LLM Workflow” section with subsections for Dataset, Model, Training, etc.). This involves naming conventions in story files or using Storybook hierarchy separators in story titles.  
       6. Test the configuration by running Storybook. Ensure that Storybook starts without errors and that a placeholder story (if any are created at this point) is accessible. This confirms that the environment is configured for the upcoming LLM components.  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       Mainly configuration data is required (paths, addon settings). No runtime data or component state is needed for this task, since it’s setting up how Storybook will behave. Storybook’s internal state may be adjusted by addons (e.g., adding toolbar items or panel state for any custom addon), but there’s no domain-specific data yet.  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       Depends on **1. Environment Setup** being complete (Storybook and required packages must be installed before configuring). This task should be done before developing specific UI components so that those components can be loaded and tested in Storybook.  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** Configuration code/files (JavaScript/JSON in Storybook config files, webpack config, addon registration). These are not user inputs but developer inputs in code format.  
       **Output:** A configured Storybook environment. The output format is the behavior of the Storybook UI – it should now include sections/placeholders for the LLM training workflow and support any added addons. In practical terms, the “output” is verified by running Storybook and observing the organized sections and absence of configuration errors (no direct data output).  

   - **Task Name:** Setting Up a Structured Project Directory  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Create a clear directory structure to organize the LLM training project. For example, at the project root, create folders such as:  
          - `datasets/` for raw and processed dataset files (if applicable),  
          - `models/` for saving trained model artifacts or checkpoints,  
          - `src/components/` for UI components (further sub-divided by feature, e.g., `components/Dataset`, `components/Model`, `components/Training`, etc.),  
          - `src/stories/` (or you can co-locate stories with components) for Storybook story files, and  
          - `training/` for training scripts or logic (if using a separate script or worker).  
       2. Ensure the Storybook configuration knows where to find stories. If you created a `src/stories` directory or placed stories alongside components, verify the glob pattern in `.storybook/main.js` (for example, `"../src/**/*.stories.@(js|tsx)"`) covers these locations.  
       3. Add placeholder files to the directories to verify the structure. For instance, create an empty `datasetSelector.component.jsx` and `datasetSelector.stories.jsx` in the Dataset component folder, a dummy `training/script.py` (if using Python) or `training/index.js` (if using JS) in the training folder, etc. These placeholders help confirm everything is wired up when running Storybook (even if they contain minimal code).  
       4. Organize any configuration or environment files. For example, ensure that there is a `package.json` at the root for Node dependencies, possibly a `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies if a Python environment is used for training, and a README or documentation file outlining the project structure for future contributors.  
       5. Test the project structure by importing one of the placeholder components into a story and running Storybook. For example, create a simple React component in `components/Dataset/DatasetSelector.jsx` that renders “Hello Dataset” and a corresponding story in `stories/Dataset.stories.jsx` to ensure that the Storybook can render it. A successful render indicates the directory setup works.  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       This task mostly involves the file system rather than runtime data. The required “data” is knowledge of what major parts (datasets, models, etc.) are needed for the workflow so appropriate directories can be made. No Storybook component state is directly involved, but having this structure prepares where stateful components will live.  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       Depends on **1.1 Installing Dependencies** (since we should initialize the project and Storybook before structuring) and **1.2 Configuring Storybook** (the config should align with the chosen structure for stories/components). It should be done early, as it will house all subsequent task implementations.  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** File system operations (creating folders and files). This is done by the developer or script, not via a UI.  
       **Output:** A well-organized project directory layout. The “format” of the output is the folder/file hierarchy itself (which can be documented as text). For example:  
       ```
       project-root/  
         ├── datasets/  
         ├── models/  
         ├── src/  
         │   ├── components/  
         │   │   ├── Dataset/ …  
         │   │   ├── Model/ …  
         │   │   ├── Training/ …  
         │   │   └── Evaluation/ …  
         │   └── stories/ …  
         └── training/  
       ```  
       This structure will be used by subsequent tasks to place their code and assets. There is no JSON/text output aside from confirming the directories exist.  

2. **Dataset Management and Preprocessing Components**  
   - **Task Name:** Creating UI Components for Dataset Selection and Visualization  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Develop a **DatasetSelector** component that provides an interface to choose a dataset. This could be a file upload button (to import a local dataset file) or a dropdown list of predefined dataset options (e.g., "Dataset A", "Dataset B").  
       2. Implement logic within the component to load and preview the selected dataset. For text-based LLM training, this might mean reading the file’s content (if allowed in the environment) or using a small sample embedded in the code. After selection, display a preview: for example, show the first few lines of text, or summary statistics like number of samples, vocabulary size, etc.  
       3. Create a corresponding Storybook story (e.g., `DatasetSelector.stories.jsx`) to render this component in isolation. Use Storybook Controls to simulate different states if possible (for instance, a control that selects which dataset option is chosen to see how the preview updates).  
       4. Ensure the component maintains state for the current selection and the loaded data preview. For example, when a user selects a dataset, store the selection in a React state hook and load the data into state. Trigger a re-render to show the preview.  
       5. (Optional) If the dataset is large, implement the preview in a lazy way – e.g., only load a portion, and perhaps show a message like “Dataset loaded with X samples”. For now, focus on functionality: confirm that when a dataset is selected, the component’s state updates and the preview area reflects the correct content.  
       6. Test the component in Storybook by interacting with it. For instance, if using a file picker, you might not actually upload a file in Storybook, so provide a fallback (like a button that simulates loading a hardcoded sample dataset). Verify that the preview UI updates accordingly.  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       - **Data:** Sample dataset content is needed to demonstrate this component. This could be a small text file included in `datasets/` (e.g., `sample.txt`) or a hardcoded string for preview purposes. Additionally, if multiple datasets are supported, a list of dataset names/paths should be available (could be coded as an array in the component or fetched from the `datasets/` directory).  
       - **Component State:** The component will have state for which dataset is selected (e.g., a filename or key) and the loaded data preview (e.g., a string of the first N lines or a summary object). In Storybook, this state is internal to the component, but Storybook Controls could be leveraged to switch dataset selection for testing.  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       Depends on **1. Environment Setup** (Storybook must be running to build this UI) and **1.3 Project Directory Setup** (to know where to place dataset files and component files). It does not strictly require Storybook configuration beyond that, and it can be built in parallel with other UI components. However, it should be completed before tasks that use the dataset data (like preprocessing or training), since those will expect a way to get dataset input.  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** User interaction in the UI – either selecting a file (which provides a file object/contents to the component) or choosing an option from a list (which the component uses to fetch data). The input format could be a file upload event or a selection event; essentially, it’s either a file path/string or file content.  
       **Output:** The component’s visual output is a preview of the dataset. If textual, this could be a snippet of text or a count of entries, etc., displayed in the Storybook canvas. Programmatically, the output could also be an event or callback (e.g., calling a handler with the loaded data). In the context of Storybook, the primary output is just the rendered preview (e.g., showing “Loaded 1000 lines, first line: ‘Once upon a time...’”). The format of underlying data might be an array of strings (lines of text) or similar structure stored in state.  

   - **Task Name:** Implementing Data Cleaning and Tokenization UI  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Create a **DataPreprocessing** component that allows users to define text cleaning options. Design a form with controls such as checkboxes or toggles for common cleaning steps: e.g., “Lowercase text”, “Remove punctuation”, “Remove stopwords”. Each control corresponds to a transformation that can be applied to raw text.  
       2. Within the component, include an area to display a sample of text before and after cleaning. This could be two text boxes side by side (Original vs. Cleaned text). When the user toggles a cleaning option, update the cleaned text in real-time by applying the selected transformations to the original sample.  
       3. Integrate a tokenization feature. Provide a dropdown or set of options for tokenization methods (for example, “Whitespace Tokenization”, “BPE Tokenizer (GPT-2)”, “WordPiece Tokenizer (BERT)” if such libraries are available in the environment). Include a button like “Apply Tokenization” or automatically tokenize after cleaning.  
       4. When tokenization is triggered, take the cleaned text and apply the selected tokenization method. This might use a library (for instance, if a JavaScript tokenizer for GPT-2 is available, or a simple split on spaces for whitespace tokenization as a placeholder). Display the tokenized output in a clear way – for example, show tokens as a list or as text separated by spaces/slashes. If the tokenizer provides token IDs, you could show those as well (perhaps in a smaller font or tooltip).  
       5. Manage component state for this process: state should hold the original text sample (perhaps coming from the selected dataset), the cleaned text (after applying current options), and the token list/result. Update these states appropriately when options change or tokenization is run.  
       6. Create a Storybook story for this component (e.g., `DataPreprocessing.stories.jsx`). For testing in Storybook, provide a default original text (for instance, a sentence or two from the sample dataset) as the input to the component. Use Controls to toggle cleaning options and switch tokenization methods to ensure the UI reacts correctly.  
       7. Verify the behavior: toggling each cleaning option should immediately reflect in the “cleaned text” output, and clicking the tokenization button (or toggling the tokenizer selection) should update the token display. Make sure to handle edge cases (e.g., no text provided, or tokenization of an empty string remains gracefully empty).  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       - **Data:** A sample text string to operate on. This will likely come from the dataset selected in the previous task (e.g., a few lines of that dataset). For Storybook isolation, you might hardcode a sample or fetch from a constant. Additionally, if using real tokenization libraries, you might need pre-trained tokenizer models or vocabulary files (for BPE/WordPiece) – those would be data files or packages installed in the environment.  
       - **Component State:** The component will maintain state for each cleaning option (e.g., boolean flags for lowercase, remove punctuation, etc.), the current cleaned text (string), the selected tokenization method, and the tokenized output (could be an array of tokens or IDs). In Storybook, the original text might be provided via args/controls, and the rest are internal state that updates as the user interacts.  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       This depends on **2.1 Dataset Selection UI** if we want to use real dataset text; the cleaning/tokenization component ideally receives raw text from the dataset component. However, during development and in Storybook, it can be built and tested with a hardcoded sample. Integration-wise, it will later connect to the dataset selection (i.e. using the data chosen there). There is also a dependency on **1.1 Installing Dependencies** if any external libraries for tokenization (such as Hugging Face tokenizers or similar) are needed – those should be installed. Otherwise, no direct UI dependency; it can be developed in parallel and integrated later.  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** The primary input is text data (a string) and user-selected options. The text input will typically be provided from the dataset (or as a default string in the component). Additionally, user input comes via toggling the cleaning checkboxes and selecting a tokenization method (and clicking a button if manual trigger is needed). These inputs are all in UI form (clicks, selections), resulting in parameters for processing functions.  
       **Output:** There are two main outputs displayed: the **cleaned text** (string format, which is the original text after transformations) and the **tokenized output** (which might be shown as a sequence of tokens). For example, if the original text is “Hello, World!!” and the user selects “Lowercase” and “Remove punctuation”, the cleaned text output becomes “hello world”. If they then tokenize (whitespace method), the token output might be `["hello", "world"]`. In terms of format: cleaned text is a string shown in a text box, and tokens could be displayed as a JSON array or simply a series of chips/tags in the UI. These outputs are not files, just on-screen results. If needed for later steps, the component could also emit an event or call a callback with the cleaned/tokenized data structure (e.g., to store it globally for training).  

   - **Task Name:** Storing Dataset Preprocessing State in Storybook.js  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Establish a mechanism to preserve state across the dataset and preprocessing components. In a typical application, this could be done via a global store (Redux, Context API, or even Storybook’s built-in state management for stories). Decide on an approach, for example, using React Context to hold the global LLM training state.  
       2. Create a context or store (e.g., `LLMTrainingContext`) that will hold data such as: selected dataset (or the dataset content), cleaned text (or full preprocessed dataset), tokenized dataset ready for training, and possibly other configuration like selected model and hyperparameters. Provide a context provider at a higher level in Storybook – perhaps wrap the stories in this provider so all components can access the shared state.  
       3. Modify the **DatasetSelector** component to save its output to the global state. For instance, when a dataset is loaded, call a context function or dispatch an action to store the raw dataset (or its path) in the global state. Similarly, when a dataset is selected, that selection can be stored so other components know which dataset is current.  
       4. Likewise, update the **DataPreprocessing** component to retrieve its input from the global state (the raw data from the selected dataset) instead of a hardcoded sample. As the user applies cleaning and tokenization, have the component update the global state with the results (e.g., store the fully processed dataset or sample). This might mean lifting some state up from the component into context, or simply calling a context update when processing is done.  
       5. Ensure that the global state is structured and accessible. For example, define a state shape like `{ dataset: {rawData, name}, preprocessing: {cleanOptions, cleanedData, tokens}, ... }`. This state object can reside in context and be updated by the components. Document or type this shape for clarity.  
       6. In Storybook, you may simulate the context by wrapping the story using a decorator. Storybook allows you to add global decorators so that each story is rendered inside the `LLMTrainingContext.Provider`. Initialize the provider with some default state (like no dataset selected initially). Verify in Storybook that selecting a dataset indeed updates the context (you might log the context value or use Storybook Actions to confirm the updates) and that the preprocessing component can read from and write to this context.  
       7. Test end-to-end within Storybook: select a dataset via the DatasetSelector UI, then ensure the DataPreprocessing UI shows the text from the selected dataset (context bridging is working). Apply a cleaning option and tokenization, then verify that those results are stored (perhaps by having a context viewer component or by checking that if you navigate to another component that reads the tokens, it sees them).  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       - **Data:** The actual dataset content (raw text or data structure) that needs to be preserved, and the processed outputs (cleaned text, tokens). These all become part of the shared data stored. There is no new external data needed beyond what was already loaded via the DatasetSelector.  
       - **Component/Global State:** This task is about creating a **global state**. The Storybook component state from previous tasks will now be lifted into this global context. For example, instead of the DatasetSelector only keeping the selection internally, it will update `globalState.dataset = {...}`. The context’s state will include fields for dataset and preprocessing. Storybook doesn’t inherently maintain state between story renders, so using a context or a store that persists for the session is key. (Alternatively, one could use Storybook’s addon state or even the URL query params for state, but context is straightforward in React.)  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       Depends on **2.1 Dataset Selection** and **2.2 Preprocessing UI** being at least stubbed or implemented, since this task connects those components via shared state. It also requires **1.2 Storybook Configuration** if any addons or adjustments are needed to support a context provider (though generally none special are required beyond adding a decorator). Ideally, this is done before proceeding to model training tasks, because those will also consume this state (e.g., the training component will need access to the processed dataset and possibly the selected dataset name or path).  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** There isn’t a direct user input for this task; instead, the “inputs” are the outputs of prior components (dataset and tokens) which need to be captured. In terms of implementation, the input is function calls or dispatches to update the store (e.g., a call like `setGlobalState({ dataset: {name: 'Dataset A', rawData: [...]}})`). The format would be in JavaScript data structures (object, array, etc.).  
       **Output:** A persisted state object representing the dataset and its preprocessing status. If one were to serialize this output, it might look like:  
       ```json
       { 
         "dataset": { "name": "Dataset A", "rawData": "Once upon a time...\nSecond line..." },
         "preprocessing": { 
             "options": { "lowercase": true, "removePunctuation": true, ... }, 
             "cleanedData": "once upon a time\nsecond line", 
             "tokens": ["once", "upon", "a", "time", "second", "line"] 
         } 
       }
       ```  
       In the Storybook UI, this output isn’t directly visible unless we make a component to display it, but it will manifest by components staying in sync (e.g., the dataset component’s selection influencing the preprocessing component’s input). Essentially, the “output” is the in-memory state that subsequent tasks (like model training) will use.  

3. **Model Architecture and Training Components**  
   - **Task Name:** Implementing UI for Selecting Model Architectures  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Define a set of available model architectures for the LLM training (e.g., GPT-2, BERT, OpenAI Whisper, etc.). Create a data structure for these options, each with a name and perhaps a brief description or relevant parameters (e.g., “GPT-2 – Decoder-only language model”, “BERT – Encoder-only language model”, “Whisper – Speech-to-text model”).  
       2. Build a **ModelSelector** UI component that presents these options to the user. A simple approach is a group of radio buttons or a dropdown menu listing the model names. The component should allow only one selection at a time (since typically one model architecture is chosen for training).  
       3. Manage state within the component for the selected model. When the user picks an option, update the state to that model choice. If using a global context (from task 2.3), also update the global state (e.g., `globalState.model.architecture = "GPT-2"`). This ensures other parts of the app know which model is chosen.  
       4. Optionally, display additional info when a model is selected. For example, if the user selects “GPT-2”, the UI might show a short text explaining this model or any specific requirements (maybe in a tooltip or a description box beneath the selector). This can be done by retrieving the description from the data structure defined in step 1 and rendering it conditionally.  
       5. Create a Storybook story (e.g., `ModelSelector.stories.jsx`) to render this component. Use Storybook Controls to test different initial selections. For instance, you could have a control for “defaultSelectedModel” that you pass as a prop to ModelSelector, to verify it highlights the correct option.  
       6. Test the component’s interactivity in Storybook: clicking different model options should correctly update the component’s state. If integrated with context, you might log the global state or use the Actions addon to see that a selection event was fired. Ensure only one model can be selected at a time and the UI clearly indicates the current selection.  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       - **Data:** A predefined list of model architecture options. This can be hardcoded in the component or imported from a constants file. For example:  
         ```js
         const modelOptions = [  
           { id: "gpt2", label: "GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)" },  
           { id: "bert", label: "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations)" },  
           { id: "whisper", label: "Whisper (OpenAI speech model)" }  
         ];
         ```  
         No external data fetching is required; it’s static data about models.  
       - **Component State:** The currently selected model option (e.g., a string or object representing the model). If using global state, this selection would also be reflected there (e.g., `globalState.model = { architecture: 'gpt2' }`). The component might also have state for any additional UI elements, like which option is hovered (if showing tooltip) but that’s minor. In Storybook, the state changes as you interact (with Controls or by clicking).  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       This depends on **1. Environment Setup** (to run Storybook) but is largely independent of dataset/preprocessing tasks. It can be implemented in parallel. However, to integrate fully, it will tie into the global state established in **2.3** so that the selection is available to the training process. It should be completed before starting the training process implementation because the training will need to know which model architecture to instantiate.  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** User’s selection input (clicking a radio button or selecting from a dropdown). Essentially, the input format is a choice of one of the predefined model identifiers.  
       **Output:** The output is an updated state indicating the chosen model. In the UI, the selected option is visually marked. Programmatically, the output could be a call to a callback or context update (for example, `onModelSelect("gpt2")`). If we consider the output format abstractly: it’s a single value (like `"gpt2"`) representing the model choice. This will later be used to configure which model to build/train.  

   - **Task Name:** Displaying Real-Time Training Metrics in Storybook  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Design a **TrainingMetrics** component to visualize training progress. Decide on which metrics to display; common ones are training loss, validation loss, and possibly accuracy or other task-specific metrics if applicable. For an LLM, training/validation loss is likely the main metric (and maybe perplexity as a derived metric).  
       2. Implement the component UI. One approach is to use a line chart that plots loss over training epochs/iterations. For example, you might integrate a chart library (like Chart.js or Recharts) to plot a series of points as the training progresses. Alternatively, a simpler approach is to have textual displays: e.g., “Current Loss: X.XX at Epoch N” and maybe a list of past epoch results.  
       3. Provide a way for this component to receive updates. If using global state, the component can subscribe to changes in a metrics array. Otherwise, you might pass data to it as props. Initially, set it up with a prop like `metricsData` which could be an array of {step: number, value: number} pairs for loss. The component should render this data (e.g., draw the line chart).  
       4. Include a real-time aspect: when training is running, new data points will stream in. Simulate this in Storybook by updating the props or using Storybook’s `useEffect` in the story to push new data periodically. For example, in the story file, you could start with an empty metrics array and use a timeout to append random values to mimic training. This will test that the component updates correctly as data changes.  
       5. Ensure the component can handle a growing dataset of points. If using a chart, verify that it re-renders efficiently as new points are added. If using text, ensure old values are either overwritten or a list doesn’t grow unbounded (maybe limit to last N entries in a log).  
       6. Style the metrics display clearly. Label axes if it’s a chart (x-axis as Epoch/Iteration, y-axis as Loss). If just text, label the numbers (“Loss: …”). Also consider using color or indicators: for instance, you could show a green arrow if loss decreased or a red if it increased on the last update (optional).  
       7. Integrate with global state or events: The training loop (to be implemented) will feed this component. For now, in Storybook, simulate feeding data. But make sure the final design allows the training process to either directly update the component’s state (if colocated) or update a context that this component reads from.  
       8. Test in Storybook thoroughly: possibly create controls to manually add a data point or reset the metrics. Ensure the component doesn’t crash with no data (e.g., before training starts, maybe show “No data yet” or just an empty chart).  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       - **Data:** The streaming metrics data. This will typically be numeric values for each time step or epoch. For example, an array: `metrics = [{ epoch: 1, trainLoss: 2.30, valLoss: 2.45 }, { epoch: 2, trainLoss: 1.95, valLoss: 2.40 }, …]`. The exact structure can vary, but you need some container for the historical metric values.  
       - **Component State:** The component might not hold much state of its own aside from perhaps the latest metrics if it needs to trigger animations. It will mainly reflect the data passed to it. If it fetches from global state, then global state would have something like `training: { metrics: [...] }`. In Storybook, you might maintain the array of metrics in the story and pass it in as a prop or via context. Also, the component may track if training is ongoing (to perhaps show a “live” indicator).  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       It depends conceptually on **4. Training Pipeline** tasks, because that’s where metrics are generated. However, it can be built earlier using simulated data. There’s a minor dependency on **1.1 Installing Dependencies** if a chart library is needed (that library should be added to the project). Aside from that, it doesn’t strictly depend on dataset or model selection tasks. It should be completed before or alongside the training pipeline implementation so that when training runs, there’s a place to display the metrics.  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** The input will be a stream of metric values. In practice, this might come as function calls or events from the training loop. For example, every time an epoch ends, the training code might call something like `updateMetrics(epoch, trainLoss, valLoss)`. In terms of format, if using context, the input is that context being updated with a new array entry; if using props, the parent passes an updated prop. So format could be an array of numbers or objects.  
       **Output:** The visual output is a real-time graph or textual log of metrics. If a line chart is used, the output format is graphical (with axes and lines). If text, it could be something like:  
       ```
       Epoch 1: Train Loss 2.30, Val Loss 2.45  
       Epoch 2: Train Loss 1.95, Val Loss 2.40  
       ...  
       ```  
       There might also be a numeric display of the latest values (e.g., “Current Loss: 1.95”). These outputs are for the user’s visualization. Additionally, the component might output nothing programmatically, as it’s the sink of data. (One could imagine it emitting an event when training is finished or if user pauses training via this UI, but such functionality isn’t specified here.)  

   - **Task Name:** Managing Hyperparameters through UI Components  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Determine the set of hyperparameters relevant for the model training. Common hyperparameters for LLM training include: learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, sequence length (for training truncation/padding), and maybe optimizer type or model-specific parameters (e.g., for GPT-2, maybe number of layers or hidden size if one is customizing architecture, though if using a fixed architecture those are static). For this UI, focus on those the user might want to tweak: learning rate, batch size, epochs, and perhaps a checkbox for “enable checkpointing” or similar.  
       2. Create a **HyperparameterForm** component with input controls for each hyperparameter. For example:  
          - Learning rate: numeric input or slider (allow decimal values, e.g., 0.001).  
          - Batch size: numeric input (integer).  
          - Epochs: numeric input (integer).  
          - [Optional] Optimizer: dropdown (e.g., Adam, SGD) if you want to allow selection.  
          - Any other relevant parameter (dropout rate, etc.) as needed.  
       3. Initialize these inputs with default values that are reasonable (e.g., LR 0.001, batch size 32, epochs 3). These defaults could be defined in a config or within the component.  
       4. When the user changes any value, update the component’s state for that parameter. Also, if using the global context, immediately reflect this change in the global state (e.g., `globalState.training.hyperparams.learningRate = 0.0005` if the user changes it). This ensures that when training is started, it uses the latest values.  
       5. Add validation or limits to inputs. For instance, ensure batch size is positive, learning rate is within a sensible range (maybe >0 and not ridiculously high), epoch is at least 1, etc. You can do simple validation on blur or on form submit, or even continuously if using a controlled input (e.g., prevent non-numeric input).  
       6. Provide a way to apply or save the hyperparameters. This could be simply that they are always “live” (stored as you type), or you might have a “Save Settings” button if you want to confirm changes. Often, just storing immediately is fine. If you include a button, that button could just log the current hyperparams or trigger an update in context explicitly.  
       7. Create a Storybook story (`HyperparameterForm.stories.jsx`). Use controls to adjust some prop if needed, but since the component will manage its own state, you might just render it and interact directly. Test that changing each field updates the internal state. If integrated with context, wrap the story with the context provider and ensure that context reflects changes (possibly by showing context values in Storybook’s actions log or by a debug component).  
       8. Check edge cases in Storybook: e.g., if user inputs an invalid value (like a letter in the batch size), ensure it’s handled (could ignore or reset to last good value). If slider is used for LR, ensure it has enough precision for small values. Make sure the defaults appear correctly on initial render.  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       - **Data:** Default hyperparameter values (could be defined in a JSON or constants). No external data is needed; these are just preset numbers.  
       - **Component State:** Each hyperparameter will have a state value (unless using uncontrolled inputs, but controlled is easier to manage). So state might look like `{ learningRate: 0.001, batchSize: 32, epochs: 3, optimizer: 'Adam' }`. If using global state, these would also be mirrored there. The component might either have its own state and then call a context update on change, or directly manipulate context as the single source of truth (in which case the context values function like state). In Storybook, you’ll likely just use the component’s internal state for testing.  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       Minimal direct dependencies. It requires **1. Environment Setup** (for Storybook to run) and is conceptually independent of dataset/model tasks. It should be implemented before the actual training pipeline execution (task 4.1) because the training process will read these hyperparameters to configure the run. Also, if global state is in use (task 2.3), integrating with that is needed so that when training starts, it has access to these values.  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** User-provided values for each hyperparameter via form fields (numeric inputs, sliders, dropdowns, etc.). For example, the user might type “16” into the batch size field or select “SGD” from an optimizer dropdown. These inputs are in standard UI formats (text input, selection).  
       **Output:** The output is a set of hyperparameter values stored and ready for use. If we consider the format, it could be an object like:  
       ```json
       { "learningRate": 0.001, "batchSize": 32, "epochs": 3, "optimizer": "Adam" }
       ```  
       This object would be stored in context or passed to the training function. There is no visual output aside from the form itself; the impact of these values will be seen when training runs (e.g., the number of epochs and the behavior of the loss curve). If there's a “save” button, clicking it might produce a console log or Storybook action event with this object (for verification).  

4. **Training Pipeline Implementation**  
   - **Task Name:** Connecting Training Scripts to Storybook UI  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Create a **TrainingController** component or utility that acts as the bridge between the UI and the actual training process. This could be a component with a “Start Training” button and maybe a status display. When the user clicks the button, the training process will begin using the configurations gathered so far.  
       2. Implement the logic to start the training. Depending on the setup:  
          - If training is done in JavaScript (e.g., using TensorFlow.js in-browser or in Node), then within this action you would initialize the model (based on selected architecture), prepare the dataset (from the global state), and start training loops or calls to the ML library’s training functions.  
          - If training is done in Python or another external process, then the button handler might spawn a child process or call an API endpoint. For example, it could execute a Python script (using Node’s `child_process.spawn` if Storybook is running in Node context) passing parameters (dataset path, model choice, hyperparams) to that script. Alternatively, it might send an HTTP request to a local server that runs the training.  
       3. Ensure that as soon as training starts, the UI reflects this. This could involve disabling the “Start Training” button to prevent double-start, and showing a message like “Training in progress...” or a spinner. You can manage a piece of state `isTraining` within this component or global context (`globalState.training.status = 'running'`).  
       4. Hook up the training progress to the Storybook UI: as the training script runs, it should output metrics (e.g., current loss). If training is within the same process, you can call context update functions directly each iteration (for example, inside a training loop, update the metrics array in context which the TrainingMetrics component is observing). If training is an external process, you need an inter-process communication: the external script could periodically write to a log file or stdout, which the Storybook side reads. For instance, you can have the child process print progress lines (`epoch X, loss Y`) and capture those lines in Node, then update the context accordingly. Alternatively, use a WebSocket or RPC mechanism for real-time updates. For simplicity, you might implement a mock: if not actually training a real model in Storybook, simulate the training loop with a timeout that updates context with dummy metrics.  
       5. Manage completion of training. Determine how to know training is finished: if internal, after the loop ends; if external, by the process exiting or sending a completion signal. When done, update the UI state (`isTraining = false`, and maybe `status = 'completed'`). Re-enable any controls, and possibly display a summary (“Training completed in X minutes”).  
       6. Pass the trained model artifact to the rest of the system. If training is internal, you will have a model object or weights at the end; store this in global state (e.g., `globalState.model.trainedModel = ...`). If external, ensure the model is saved to a known location (like `models/final_model.pth`) and perhaps store the path or load it back into memory if feasible. This is important for the inference step later.  
       7. Test this pipeline in the development environment. In Storybook, full training of a large model is not practical, so use a simplified scenario: for example, train a very small model for a couple of epochs on dummy data, or just simulate the loop with fake data. Ensure that clicking start triggers the sequence, that the metrics component updates, and that completion resets the UI state. Use console logs or Storybook Actions to debug that the data flows correctly (e.g., log the metrics being sent).  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       - **Data:** The training process needs access to: (a) the processed dataset (likely as tensors or arrays of token ids and labels), (b) the model architecture details (to either select the proper model class or load a pre-defined model), and (c) hyperparameters like learning rate, epochs, etc. All of these are gathered from previous tasks and should be available in the global state or easily passed to the training function. Also, if using an external script, data might be file paths – e.g., dataset saved to a temporary file and model architecture name to decide which model to build in the script.  
       - **State:** Several state elements are involved:  
         - Training status (idle/running/completed) and possibly progress (e.g., current epoch number).  
         - Training metrics (which are continuously updated – see task 3.2 – and stored in e.g., `globalState.training.metrics`).  
         - The trained model (after completion, either as an in-memory object or reference to saved file, stored in `globalState.model.trainedModel` or similar).  
         - If an external process is used, state might include the child process handle or a flag that it’s connected. In Storybook context, though, we likely won’t store a process handle in React state; instead, just manage that internally in the module.  
       - The component state for TrainingController might just be `isTraining` and maybe `statusMessage`. The rest (metrics, model) is in global state.  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       This is dependent on almost all prior configuration tasks: **2.3 Global State** (to get data and provide outputs), **2.1 Dataset Selection** and **2.2 Preprocessing** (to supply the training data), **3.1 Model Selection** (to know which model to train), and **3.3 Hyperparameters UI** (to get training settings). It also assumes **1.1 Dependencies Installed** (since training will use PyTorch/TensorFlow etc.). Essentially, this is the culmination of previous UI inputs. It should be implemented after those inputs are ready, and it will integrate with **3.2 Metrics Component** to display progress.  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** The inputs to this task are not from a single user action but multiple sources:  
       - Direct user input: clicking the “Start Training” button (this triggers the pipeline).  
       - Config inputs collected: dataset (could be a path or in-memory data structure), model architecture (an identifier or class), hyperparameters (object of values). These are fed into the training function. Format-wise, the dataset might be an array or tensor, the model choice could be a string like `"gpt2"`, and hyperparams an object as outlined in 3.3.  
       **Output:** The outputs include:  
       - **Side-effect outputs:** The training process itself (which is not a UI output but a process that runs possibly producing console output or files). For instance, it will create model weight files or update logs.  
       - **UI outputs:** Updates to the UI as training progresses. Specifically, the metrics component will output new points on the chart (format: numeric values plotted), and the TrainingController might output status messages (“Epoch 1/5 completed”).  
       - **Final output:** The trained model artifact. If in memory, it doesn’t have a visual representation but is stored (could be considered an output in the data sense). If it’s saved to disk, that file (e.g., `models/final_model.onnx` or `.pth`) is an output. In Storybook UI, upon completion, one might show “Model training complete. Model saved at /models/final_model.pth” as an output message.  
       In summary, format-wise: real-time output is a series of metric values (numbers) and final output is a model file or object.  

   - **Task Name:** Setting Up Model Checkpointing and Validation Tracking  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Augment the training loop (from task 4.1) to include checkpointing. Determine a checkpoint strategy: e.g., save a checkpoint at the end of each epoch or every N batches. Implement logic in the training script such that after the specified interval, the current model state is saved to a file. For instance, after each epoch, call a save function to write `model_epoch{n}.pth` (for PyTorch) or `model_epoch{n}.ckpt` to the `models/` directory. Ensure the directory exists (which it should from task 1.3) and handle overwriting or keeping multiple files as needed (e.g., you might keep only the latest or all of them).  
       2. Incorporate validation during training. Assume we have a validation split or dataset (it could be that the dataset is pre-split, or we take a portion of the training data as validation). At the end of each epoch (or at some interval), evaluate the model on the validation data. This means running a forward pass on the validation dataset without gradient updates and computing metrics like validation loss (and perhaps accuracy or other metrics if relevant).  
       3. Feed the validation results into the UI as part of the metrics. Update the global state or metrics data structure to include validation metrics. For example, if you have been pushing training loss points, also push a validation loss point for that epoch. The TrainingMetrics component can be adapted to display two lines (one for training loss, one for validation loss). If it’s not already multi-metric, update it to handle an object with both values. Alternatively, maintain separate series and update accordingly.  
       4. Optimize checkpointing to not freeze the UI: saving models can be I/O heavy, so if training is in the browser, consider using async operations or at least indicating in the UI when saving happens (maybe briefly display “saving checkpoint...”). In a Node/Python scenario, just ensure it doesn’t block the UI thread if the UI is separate. This may be too low-level for Storybook context; the key is to simulate it smoothly if not truly training a large model.  
       5. After training completion, ensure the final model is saved if not already via checkpoint. You might treat the last epoch’s checkpoint as the final model or explicitly save “final_model.pth”. Record the path or reference of this final model in global state for later use (in inference tasks).  
       6. If feasible, implement an option in the UI to configure checkpointing frequency or validation usage. For example, a field in the hyperparameter form for “checkpoint every N epochs” or a toggle “Use Validation Split”. If added, ensure those settings are respected by the training loop (e.g., check that toggle before doing validation). If not implementing as UI, just document that by default it checkpoints every epoch and uses X% for validation.  
       7. Test checkpointing and validation in a controlled environment. In Storybook, simulate a short training with checkpointing: e.g., if training for 3 epochs, you should see 3 checkpoint files created (log this to console or ensure they appear in the file system if running locally). For validation, perhaps create a dummy validation set (like a small subset of data) and compute a simple metric. Ensure the metrics component in Storybook now shows two lines if you implemented that (train vs val). Check that the global state after training includes something like `globalState.model.latestCheckpoint = "models/final_model.pth"`.  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       - **Data:** The validation dataset. If the original dataset is large, one could have split it earlier. For testing, you can just copy a portion of the dataset array for validation. Also, a directory path for saving models is needed (e.g., `models/checkpoints/`). The filenames for checkpoints will be generated (strings). No new input data beyond what’s already there; it’s about using the data differently (for validation) and producing output data (model files).  
       - **State:**  
         - A setting for checkpoint frequency (could be a hyperparameter like `checkpointInterval` if implemented).  
         - Training progress state should now include information about validation: e.g., `globalState.training.metrics` might become `{ trainLoss: [...], valLoss: [...] }` or each entry has both.  
         - State to store the latest checkpoint path or a list of checkpoint paths. For example, `globalState.training.checkpoints = ["models/model_epoch1.pth", ...]` and/or `globalState.model.latestCheckpoint = "models/model_epoch3.pth"`.  
         - Possibly a state for best validation score if tracking best model (not asked, but common in training).  
         - The existence of a validation dataset could be stored (like `globalState.dataset.validationSplit = 0.1` or similar if needed).  
       - The rest of component state from TrainingController (isTraining, etc.) remains as before, just extended for these new actions.  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       This extends **4.1 Training Connection**, so it depends on that being in place. It also inherently depends on having data and a model (tasks in section 2 and 3). For creating a validation set, it depends on **2.3 Preprocessing State** because the dataset needs to be accessible to split or designate a part for validation. It might also depend on a decision from **3.3 Hyperparameters UI** if we let the user specify validation percentage or checkpoint intervals. If not, then no direct UI dependency beyond the training loop. In summary, this is part of the training process, so it comes after those tasks and should be done in tandem with building the training loop.  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:**  
       - Implicit input: The ongoing training state at certain intervals (end of epoch or step) triggers the checkpoint/save function. That function takes as input the current model parameters and a file path format. For example, input to checkpoint function: model object/weights, and filename "model_epoch1.pth".  
       - For validation, input is the validation data (as arrays/tensors) and the current model (to evaluate).  
       - If a user setting for checkpointing exists, that value (e.g., every 1 epoch) is an input determining frequency.  
       **Output:**  
       - Checkpoint files written to disk (e.g., the model’s state_dict saved in a .pth file). This is a major output artifact (format: binary file, specific to the framework).  
       - Updates to the metrics output: specifically validation metrics. For instance, after epoch 1, we might output an additional point “Val Loss: 2.45”. In the metrics data structure, this could be an array of numbers aligned with epoch count.  
       - Perhaps console or log outputs confirming saving (“Checkpoint saved: model_epoch1.pth”).  
       - The final output would be a final model file (if not already saved as last checkpoint) and a possibly updated global state noting completion.  
       In terms of format for UI, if we chart training vs validation, the output is a dual-line chart with those two series. If we list metrics, output might be text like: “Epoch 1: Train Loss 2.30, Val Loss 2.45” etc.  
       The checkpoint files themselves have no UI representation (except maybe a message or a list of files, which we might not show unless we create a UI element for it).  

5. **Inference and Evaluation Components**  
   - **Task Name:** Designing UI for Testing Trained Models  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Develop an **InferenceTester** component that allows a user to interact with the trained model. For an LLM, this typically means providing a prompt or input text and getting the model’s generated completion or response. Design the component interface with at least: an input text box (for the prompt) and an output area (for the model’s response).  
       2. Include a “Run Inference” or “Generate” button. When clicked, the component should take the text from the input field and use the trained model to generate output. This requires access to the trained model: if the model is in memory (from the training step), it could call a function directly. If the model is only saved on disk, you may need to load it (which could be done at component mount or on demand) into memory or call an API that returns the inference result. For example, if using a Python backend, the button handler might send the prompt to a Flask server or run a Python script with the prompt, loading the model file and returning the result.  
       3. Manage the state for inference: have state for `inputText` (bound to the input field), `outputText` (to store the model’s answer), and maybe `isGenerating` (boolean to indicate if inference is in progress, to disable the button and show a spinner).  
       4. Upon clicking the button, set `isGenerating` to true and clear any old output. Then perform the inference: if running locally, call the model’s generate method with the prompt. For instance, if it’s a transformer model, you’d pass the tokenized prompt through and sample from it. If using an external call, simulate this by a timeout or a mock function in Storybook that after a second returns a canned response (since running a full model might not be feasible in Storybook environment).  
       5. When the result is obtained, update `outputText` state with the generated text and set `isGenerating` to false. The UI should then display the output in the output area. The output area could be a simple `<div>` or `<pre>` to preserve formatting, maybe scrollable if output is long.  
       6. (Optional) Provide controls for inference settings – e.g., a slider for "temperature" or "max length" of generation. These are advanced features: if included, manage their state and use them in the generation function call. If not, just use sensible defaults in the backend (like fixed max length).  
       7. Add a Storybook story (`InferenceTester.stories.jsx`). In the story, since a real model might not be present, you can inject a dummy function for generating text. For example, have a prop `onGenerate` that if provided will be used instead of the real model call. In the story, pass an `onGenerate` that returns a preset string like `"Hello, this is a test response."` after a short delay. This allows you to simulate and verify the loading state and output display.  
       8. Test in Storybook by typing into the input and clicking the button. Verify that the loading state triggers (maybe disable button and show "Loading..."), and then the dummy output appears in the output area. Also test edge cases: empty prompt (perhaps disable button if input is empty or handle it by showing an error or just not calling model), and multiple consecutive runs (should handle clearing previous output or appending as needed).  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       - **Data:** The core data needed is the trained model itself (or access to it). If the model is in memory (say, a TensorFlow.js model object or a reference to a PyTorch module via some binding), that data must be accessible. If it’s not possible to hold it in the UI context, then an API endpoint or function that can produce output given an input string is needed. For testing in Storybook, you’ll use a stubbed response. Additionally, any static text or example prompts might be useful (for example, showing a placeholder in the input like “Type a prompt…”).  
       - **Component State:**  
         - `inputText` (string): bound to the prompt input field.  
         - `outputText` (string): holds the model’s output text to display.  
         - `isGenerating` (boolean): indicates if a generation is in progress (to handle UI feedback).  
         - If inference settings like temperature are included, their state as well (e.g., `temperature: 1.0`).  
         - The component might also rely on global state for the model (e.g., if `globalState.model.trainedModel` holds a reference or a function to call for inference, it might use that).  
       - The global state could store the model or a function to run it. Alternatively, the component could import a singleton that was set when training completed. This is an architectural detail – in context of tasks, assume global state has what’s needed (like a path or object for the model).  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       Depends heavily on **4. Training Pipeline** tasks, because without a trained model, this component has nothing real to query. It specifically requires that a model is available (either in memory or as a saved file). It also may depend on **4.2 Checkpointing** in the sense that it needs to know where the final model is saved if loading from file. To build the UI, you don’t need the actual model (you can stub it), but to integrate fully, the training must be done. Additionally, if the model architecture selection (task 3.1) affects the inference method (e.g., different tokenization or generation parameters), the component might need to adjust accordingly, so being aware of which model was trained is useful (like if it's a text model vs speech model, but presumably all are text for simplicity).  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** The primary input is the text prompt entered by the user (string). Also, the user triggers the action by clicking the generate button. If there are additional generation settings, those values (e.g., temperature as a number) are inputs too, but typically set via UI controls rather than typed.  
       **Output:** The output is the model’s generated text (string) shown on the UI. For example, user inputs: `"Once upon a time,"` and the output might be `" there lived a brave knight who..."`. This is a free-form text output. If this were a different kind of model (like Q&A, classification, etc.), the format would change accordingly (e.g., a label or a transcription), but as an LLM we assume text generation. Programmatically, if this were an API call, the output could come as JSON containing the text, but since we integrate directly, we handle it as a string. The component might also output an event or call a callback when done (e.g., to notify that inference happened), but not required. In summary: **Input format:** text string; **Output format:** text string.  

   - **Task Name:** Implementing Visual Representation of Model Predictions  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Decide what form of visualization will add insight into the model’s predictions. For language model text output, one idea is to highlight each word/token by some confidence or probability. Another idea is to show a bar chart of next-word probabilities at a certain point. However, without modifying the model to output probabilities, we might simulate or use logit info if available. A simpler approach: highlight differences between model output and some reference (if one exists) or just format the output text in a user-friendly way (like preserving line breaks or showing it in a typewriter effect).  
       2. For demonstration, implement a **PredictionVisualizer** component that can take the model’s output text (from the previous task) and perhaps the input prompt, and display a richer view. For example, one approach:  
          - Split the output text into tokens (maybe by spaces or using the same tokenizer if accessible).  
          - If you have probability data for each token (say the model’s softmax outputs), map those to a color intensity. If not, you might assign a dummy/confidence for illustration (or skip actual probability).  
          - Render the output text such that each token is wrapped in a span with a background color or underline whose intensity reflects confidence (e.g., more confident = darker background). This would require hooking into the model’s internals; if that’s not available, you could still do something like alternate colors for tokens just to visually separate them.  
       3. Another visualization: if comparing model output to expected output (like for evaluation with a ground truth), highlight correct vs incorrect tokens. But since this is a general LLM prompt, there’s no ground truth, so we won’t do that.  
       4. If the model is of a type where output is not text (imagine Whisper outputs text from audio, or an image captioning model outputs text from an image), the visualization could include the input modality (like an audio waveform or image with caption). The task hints at LLM, so likely text-in, text-out, so we’ll focus on textual visualization.  
       5. Implement the component to update whenever a new model output is available. If using context, after inference, the output text is stored in global state (e.g., `globalState.inference.lastOutput`). The PredictionVisualizer can subscribe to that or be a child of the InferenceTester component and receive the output as a prop. It will then render accordingly.  
       6. Provide controls in the visualization if needed. For example, a toggle to switch between “raw text” and “visualized” modes, or a slider to adjust a threshold if highlighting confidences. This can make it interactive and allow the user to explore the output.  
       7. Create a Storybook story (`PredictionVisualizer.stories.jsx`). Feed it some sample output text and (optionally) fake confidence data. For instance, provide a prop like `predictedText="The quick brown fox"` and maybe a prop `confidences=[0.9, 0.6, 0.2, 0.95]` for each token just to test the coloring logic. Verify that the text renders and the styling reflects the confidences (if implemented). If no confidences, just ensure it displays properly. If there are mode toggles, test switching them.  
       8. Integrate with the inference UI: ensure that when the InferenceTester obtains a result, it either renders the PredictionVisualizer with that output or passes the data to it. In Storybook, you might combine them in one story to see the end-to-end: user enters prompt, gets output, which is then visualized with highlights. Since actual model confidences might not be accessible, this could remain a conceptual feature unless using a specific library that provides token probabilities.  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       - **Data:** Model output text (as generated by inference). Optionally, additional data per token such as probabilities or ranks. If we had access to the full output distribution at each step, that would be data here, but likely not. Another form of data could be a dictionary of special tokens or highlights (like if we wanted to highlight all occurrences of certain words). For simplicity, assume the main data is the output text string.  
       - **Component State:** If the visualizer is purely presentational given props, it might not need much state. It could derive everything from the input text each time it’s updated. If it has modes (raw vs highlighted), that mode could be a local state or a prop. If it has an interactive element like a slider for threshold, that’s local state. But core output is passed in. If probabilities or metrics are passed in parallel arrays, those could be considered part of its props data.  
       - In a context scenario, `globalState.inference.lastOutput` might contain `text` and maybe `tokenConfidences: []`. The visualizer would read from that.  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       Depends on **5.1 Testing Trained Models** because it visualizes the output of that task. It should be done after or alongside building the inference component. There is also a dependency on actually having something to visualize (a model output), but during development, you can use dummy text. To the extent it might use model internals (e.g., probabilities), it depends on either the model’s capability or some extension of the inference process to provide that data. If we consider evaluation tasks (5.3) where a ground truth might be known, such visualizer could also be used to compare prediction vs truth, but that’s more relevant for evaluation dashboards. For now, main dependency is the existence of the output text.  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** The input to the visualizer is the model’s output data. Simplest case: a text string (the generated output). If enhancing with token-level info: input could be an array of tokens and an array of confidence scores (both aligned). For example:  
       ```json
       { "tokens": ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox"], "confidences": [0.95, 0.87, 0.76, 0.92] }
       ```  
       Or simply the combined data could be embedded in the text as annotations.  
       **Output:** The output is a rich UI rendering of the prediction. For example, it might output:  
       ```
       The [quick] [brown] fox  
       ```  
       where [quick] and [brown] are colored differently. If using HTML/CSS, each token might be a span with style, which in plain text here we can’t show colors, but the idea is a highlighted text. If multiple forms of visualization are supported, the output might also include a chart or other elements. In general, it transforms the raw output into a more visually informative format. There’s no new data output from this component – it’s the end of the line, presenting to the user.  

   - **Task Name:** Creating Evaluation Dashboards in Storybook.js  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Determine what evaluation metrics or results you want to present for the trained model. This often includes: final training vs validation loss curves (which we already have from training metrics), overall performance on a test set (e.g., accuracy, BLEU score, ROUGE score, etc., depending on the task), and examples of model outputs versus expected outputs (if a supervised task). In the context of a general LLM trained on unsupervised data, we might not have a straightforward accuracy, but if we fine-tuned on a specific task or have a benchmark, we could include that. For demonstration, assume we have a held-out test set with some perplexity or that we can at least show the loss curves and maybe sample outputs.  
       2. Implement an **EvaluationDashboard** component that aggregates various pieces of information:  
          - **Training Curves Chart:** Reuse or embed the TrainingMetrics component to show the full loss curves for train and validation across epochs. If the TrainingMetrics component was only showing during training, you might need to supply it with the stored data after training. Alternatively, generate a static chart image or use the same library to draw from the saved metrics array.  
          - **Final Metrics Summary:** Display key numbers like “Final Training Loss: X”, “Final Validation Loss: Y”, and any other metric like “Validation Perplexity: Z” or “Test Perplexity: W”. If the model was evaluated on a test set, list those results. This can be a simple list or table.  
          - **Sample Outputs:** If there is a known set of evaluation prompts and expected answers (like for QA or translation tasks), present a few examples comparing the model’s output to the ground truth. For a general LLM, we could use a small set of prompts (not seen during training) and show what the model generates for them. This gives a qualitative sense of performance. Implement this as a sub-component or section: e.g., a table with two columns (“Model says” vs “Expected” if supervised) or just a list of prompts and model responses if no expected answer.  
       3. Arrange these sections in the dashboard layout. For example, at the top the metrics chart, below it the summary stats, and then some example outputs. Use headings or dividers to clearly label each part. Possibly utilize Storybook’s flexible layout (the canvas area is just a React component, so you can style it with CSS or components).  
       4. Ensure the component can get the required data, likely via props or context. For instance, it might accept a `results` object that contains the arrays for losses and the metrics. The global state after training could hold `globalState.training.metrics` and also perhaps `globalState.training.finalMetrics = {trainLoss: X, valLoss: Y}` and maybe `globalState.evaluation.testMetrics = {...}`. The EvaluationDashboard can pull from there. In Storybook, since training would be done already, you might manually supply these as props to the story.  
       5. Create a Storybook story (`EvaluationDashboard.stories.jsx`). For demonstration, you may need to simulate a finished training run: e.g., provide dummy data for metrics (maybe reuse some from when you tested training) and some made-up final values. Also prepare a couple of example prompts and pre-written model outputs (since we can’t run the model in storybook easily for new prompts unless using the inference component). Hardcode or generate a small array like:  
          ```js
          const examples = [  
             { prompt: "Once upon a time", modelOutput: " there was a brave knight who...", expectedOutput: null },  
             { prompt: "What is the capital of France?", modelOutput: "The capital of France is Paris.", expectedOutput: "Paris" }  
          ];  
          ```  
          Here the first is just a random prompt with no expected, the second has a known expected answer. Use these in the dashboard.  
       6. Verify in Storybook that all pieces render correctly: the chart shows up with the dummy curve, the metrics summary displays the numbers, and the examples list shows the prompts and model outputs (and highlights if it matches expected for the second example, maybe).  
       7. (Optional) Add interactivity: for instance, allow the user to input a new prompt directly in the dashboard to test the model (this overlaps with the inference component, so not necessary if we already have that separate). Or allow toggling which metrics to view if there were many. However, a dashboard is often static after training.  
       8. Once integrated, this dashboard would be something you view after training is done (maybe as a separate Storybook story or as the final step in the workflow). Confirm that if using global state, it correctly picks up the data from training tasks when they complete. If needed, you might populate the global state with final results at training completion so that this component can read them.  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       - **Data:**  
         - Training history data: arrays for training and validation loss (and/or accuracy) across epochs.  
         - Final metrics: numeric values summarizing performance (could include loss, perplexity, accuracy on test).  
         - Evaluation examples: a set of prompt/response pairs, possibly with expected responses for comparison.  
         - These would typically come from the training process and a subsequent evaluation run on a test set. The test set itself (if any) is also data that would have been defined somewhere; if we had a labeled dataset for a specific task, that would be used to produce accuracy/score. If not, we might just skip accuracy and focus on unsupervised metrics like loss or perplexity.  
       - **Component State:** The dashboard itself might not need to maintain much internal state because it’s mostly a display. It might have state for UI interactions (like which example to highlight or if there’s a filter), but as specified, it’s largely static given the data. It will receive the data via context or props and render it. If we allow some toggling of charts or something, that would be a state (e.g., show/hide validation curve), but that’s an extra feature.  
       - In Storybook, we might just hardcode the data in the story, so the component will be functionally stateless (just presenting props).  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       This is dependent on **4. Training Pipeline** (to have metrics) and also on having some evaluation results. It’s essentially a post-training step, so it comes after training and possibly after the model testing as well. If one wanted to evaluate on a test set, that could be considered part of this task: running the model on a test set could be done right after training is finished (maybe triggered automatically in the training script or via a separate “Evaluate” button). The results of that would feed into this dashboard. So implicitly, it depends on having a trained model and (optionally) a test dataset and some evaluation code. If using global state, tasks in section 4 would store needed info for this. If any new code is needed to compute test metrics, that would be done just before populating the dashboard.  
       It does not directly depend on the inference UI (5.1) or visualization (5.2), those are more interactive testing. This is more summary, but it could incorporate some of their elements (like example outputs could reuse the visualization). In timeline, it’s last.  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** The input is a collection of evaluation results data:  
       - Loss curves: perhaps an array of numbers for training loss per epoch and same for validation (or a single array of objects with both). For example: `trainLoss = [2.3, 1.9, 1.5]`, `valLoss = [2.4, 2.1, 1.8]`.  
       - Final metrics: could be a simple object like `{ finalTrainLoss: 1.5, finalValLoss: 1.8, testPerplexity: 30.2 }`.  
       - Examples: an array of `{ prompt, modelOutput, expectedOutput? }` as described.  
       These would be fed into the component as props or pulled from global state.  
       **Output:** The output is a composite UI:  
       - A chart (or image of one) showing the loss curves over epochs – output in UI is visual with axes.  
       - Textual metrics summary – output as a list or table of "Metric: value". Possibly formatted as HTML table or list in the DOM.  
       - Example outputs – output as text blocks, possibly formatted in a table or as blockquotes under each prompt. If comparing to expected, maybe the expected answer is shown in a different color or side-by-side with the model’s answer.  
       There's no new data output from the component, it's the end presentation. If this were an actual app, one might allow exporting this report (e.g., as a PDF or JSON), but within Storybook, it's just for display.  

6. **Deployment and Optimization UI**  
   - **Task Name:** UI for Exporting Trained Models in Various Formats  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Create a **ModelExport** component that enables users to select export format options for the trained model and initiate the export. Determine which formats to support: likely candidates are **PyTorch model (.pt/.pth)**, **ONNX**, and maybe **TensorFlow SavedModel or Keras H5** if relevant. If the model is initially in PyTorch (common for LLMs), ONNX export would be a typical choice for interoperability, and perhaps TorchScript as well.  
       2. Provide a set of checkboxes or toggle buttons for each available format. For example: “[ ] PyTorch (.pth)”, “[ ] ONNX”, “[ ] TensorFlow SavedModel”. The user can check one or multiple. Alternatively, a dropdown where the user selects one format at a time to export (and triggers each separately). The UI should clearly indicate what each format is (maybe include a brief note for each or a tooltip).  
       3. Include an “Export Model” button. When clicked, it will carry out the export for the selected format(s). Implement the onClick handler to perform the following for each selected format:  
          - If Storybook is running in Node context (i.e., a dev environment with access to file system and the training artifacts), call the appropriate function to save/convert the model. For example, if exporting PyTorch, you might call `torch.save(model_state, 'model.pth')` via the Python training environment or an API. For ONNX, if PyTorch, use `torch.onnx.export(model, sample_input, 'model.onnx')` given a sample input tensor. For TensorFlow, if the model was in TF or converted, use `model.save('path')`. This likely requires the model in memory and the appropriate framework libraries available.  
          - If Storybook is purely front-end (browser), you cannot directly use PyTorch to save a file. Instead, you might simulate this by calling an API on the backend that performs the export and returns a downloadable link or by using something like ONNX.js if converting in browser (but conversion to ONNX in browser is not trivial). For planning, assume we have a backend environment accessible (since we installed PyTorch etc.).  
       4. Provide feedback to the user: when export starts, maybe show a message “Exporting to ONNX...” and then “Export successful!” or an error if it fails. If running within Storybook’s Node process, you can catch success/failure and update state accordingly. If asynchronous, manage a loading state per format. Optionally, for a successful export, you could present a download link or the file path. In a local dev environment, just showing the path where it was saved (like `models/export/model.onnx`) might suffice.  
       5. Ensure the component can handle multiple exports sequentially or one at a time. If the user selects multiple formats and clicks once, you’ll loop through each. If you want to enforce one at a time, use separate trigger per format (but combined is user-friendly).  
       6. Storybook story (`ModelExport.stories.jsx`): Since actual export might not be feasible in the browser, simulate the behavior. For each format, you could mock the export function to just wait 1 second and then “succeed.” Use component state or a context action to log which formats would have been exported. For demonstration, you might have the story initially mark a model as available (like a flag `modelTrained=true` to enable the button). Test by selecting formats and clicking export, and show that the UI updates (maybe set state like `exportStatus = "Exported ONNX and PyTorch successfully"`).  
       7. Verify that selecting no format and clicking export either does nothing or shows a validation message (perhaps disable the button unless at least one format is checked). Also test each combination of selections to see that the feedback covers all chosen ones.  
       8. Consider where the model is coming from: the component should access the trained model. If the model is in global state (say, a PyTorch `model` object or a path to weights), ensure the export logic uses that. If not present, the Export button should be disabled (and maybe a note “No trained model available to export”). For the story, we can assume a model is available.  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       - **Data:** The trained model (in memory or the path to the model weights). This is critical; without it, export can’t happen. Also, possibly a sample input tensor shape is needed for ONNX export (e.g., sequence length and batch size). That could be derived from the dataset or be a constant if we know it (like for language models, maybe a fixed sequence length used during training, say 128 tokens). We might need to supply a dummy input of that shape to the export function. This info (like input dimension) is another piece of data to have.  
       - **Component State:**  
         - Which formats are selected (e.g., an object or separate booleans: `{ exportPyTorch: true, exportONNX: false, exportTF: false }`).  
         - Export status messages or flags (like `isExporting` to indicate an ongoing process, and perhaps a map of format to success message or error). For example, after running, you might store `{ lastExportResult: "PyTorch and ONNX exported successfully to /models/export/..." }` or something more structured.  
         - If providing a download link in a web context, you might store the blob or link for the file, but in Node context, just path is fine.  
       - Global state might not need to store much for this aside from the model itself. Possibly, a reference like `globalState.model.object` or `globalState.model.path` (path of final checkpoint) is needed.  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       It depends on **4. Training Pipeline** (for the model to be trained and available). Ideally, the model to export is the final model from training or a chosen checkpoint. So it also relates to **4.2 Checkpointing** because you might export the best checkpoint or final checkpoint. The UI could potentially allow choosing which checkpoint to export, but that’s an extra feature; we’ll assume exporting the final model. So it needs that final model.  
       Also, it assumes the environment has the capability to export. We installed PyTorch/TF in **1.1**, so presumably yes. If the model architecture is known, exporting to ONNX depends on the code to build the model in PyTorch and a dummy input. So there's a dependency on model architecture selection (3.1) in that the code to instantiate the model should be available and aligned. The actual call will use that architecture’s instance.  
       There’s a minor dependency on **1.3 Project Directory** since we want a consistent place to save exports (like maybe a subfolder `models/export/`). That folder should exist or be created.  
       This should be implemented after the model training is done and preferably after the inference step (though not strictly required to do after inference, but logically you train, maybe test, then export).  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** User’s selection of export format (via UI checkboxes) and the action of clicking the export button. In a more system sense, the input to the export function is the trained model data (e.g., a PyTorch model object or weight file) and possibly the target format identifier. For example, one invocation might be `(modelObject, "onnx", "models/export/model.onnx")`. If the model is large, nothing is directly input by the user besides initiating the command.  
       **Output:** The main output is one or more model files saved in the chosen formats. For instance:  
       - If PyTorch selected: a file like `model.pth` on disk containing the state dict.  
       - If ONNX selected: a file `model.onnx` on disk (or potentially offered as a download if front-end).  
       - If TensorFlow selected: a directory with SavedModel files or an .h5 file.  
       The UI output is a confirmation message or link: e.g., “Model exported to ONNX format at `/models/export/model.onnx`.” If multiple, list each result. If an error, e.g., “ONNX export failed: unsupported operator”, show that.  
       In summary, file outputs (binary formats) and UI textual feedback.  

   - **Task Name:** Implementing Optimization Features (Quantization Selection)  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Expand the model export or deployment UI to include model optimization options. Specifically, implement a **QuantizationOption** control that lets the user choose to apply quantization to the trained model. This could be a checkbox “Apply INT8 Quantization” or a dropdown with options like “No Quantization (FP32)”, “Dynamic Quantization (INT8)”, “Half-Precision (FP16)”. For initial simplicity, use a single checkbox for INT8 quantization (which is common for speeding up inference).  
       2. If the user selects the quantization option, integrate this choice into the model export process or make it a separate step just before export. For example, the UI flow could be: user checks "INT8 Quantization", then clicks "Export ONNX". The logic would then quantize the model and export it. Alternatively, you could have a separate “Optimize Model” button that produces a quantized model in memory or as a file.  
       3. Implement the quantization process using the available tools:  
          - For PyTorch, you can use `torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8)` to apply dynamic quantization on certain layers (like Linear layers in transformers). This would produce a new model object that is quantized.  
          - For TensorFlow, one might convert to TFLite with quantization parameters, but given we have PyTorch installed, focus on PyTorch’s quantization.  
          - If exporting to ONNX, one approach is to quantize after exporting using ONNX Runtime’s quantization tools (offline). But that’s complex; simpler: quantize the PyTorch model then export that quantized model to ONNX (if PyTorch quantization is applied, it will reflect in the exported ONNX possibly as INT8 ops).  
       4. Implement this in code: when quantization is requested, before saving the model, call the quantization function. Then proceed to save the quantized model using the export code. If quantizing to half precision, you might call `model.half()` in PyTorch or specify `dtype=torch.float16`. Ensure to handle this differently depending on model type (some layers might not support int8 easily, but dynamic quant should mostly work on linear layers).  
       5. Provide user feedback. For instance, after quantization and export, you might show “Quantized model exported. Size reduced from X MB to Y MB.” To do this, you could compare file sizes: if you saved both FP32 and INT8 versions, measure their bytes (though in Storybook context you might not actually do that; you can simulate by noting typical reductions). Alternatively, just confirm “Quantized export successful”.  
       6. Allow the quantization option to also be used for deployment (if applicable). If the next task is deployment, maybe the user can choose to deploy a quantized model for efficiency. So maintain that state if needed (e.g., store that a quantized model was created).  
       7. Test in Storybook: In the story for ModelExport or a separate story focusing on optimization, simulate the quantization process. Because we likely cannot run actual PyTorch quantization in the browser, stub it: for example, when the box is checked and export clicked, set state as if a quantized model was produced. You can log a message “Quantization applied” and pretend the file saved is smaller. If you have access to Node in Storybook (which you might, since Storybook runs webpack and maybe can run Node scripts if configured), you could in theory quantize a trivial model for demonstration, but it's not necessary to go that far.  
       8. Check that with no quantization selected, export works normally, and with quantization selected, the alternate path is taken. Also ensure the UI clearly shows the relationship (maybe grey-out quantization checkbox or show it only when a certain format is selected that supports it—e.g., quantization might be mostly relevant for ONNX or PyTorch, but less for TensorFlow unless using TFLite).  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       - **Data:** The trained model (same as for export) is needed, since quantization is an operation on the model. Also, if quantizing, you might need a representative input sample for static quantization (but dynamic quantization in PyTorch doesn’t require a calibration dataset). We might skip static quantization due to complexity.  
       - **State:**  
         - A boolean or value indicating the selected quantization option (e.g., `applyQuantization: true/false` or `quantizationMode: 'INT8' | 'FP16' | 'none'`).  
         - Possibly store results like model size or performance metrics pre- and post-quantization if you intend to display them (optional). E.g., `modelSizeBefore` and `modelSizeAfter`.  
         - The export process state will incorporate this (like when running, know to quantize first).  
         - After export, one might update a state like `lastExport.wasQuantized = true` to record that.  
       - Global state might not need to explicitly store quantization choice long term, unless you want to remember the user’s selection for future exports. It can be ephemeral.  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       This depends on **6.1 Model Export UI** because quantization is an extension of exporting or a preparatory step for it. It also, of course, needs the model from training (so depends on section 4 completion). If implementing quantization fully, it relies on PyTorch being available (from task 1.1) and the model architecture (from task 3.1) being suitable for quantization. It should be implemented alongside or after the export feature. Possibly also before deployment, as deploying a quantized model is beneficial.  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** The user’s action of selecting a quantization option and then triggering export or optimization. The internal input to the quantization function is the model object and a specification of how to quantize (which layers or overall dynamically). For example, the function call might look like `quantized_model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8)`.  
       **Output:** The output is an optimized (quantized) model. If in memory, it’s a model object of a different type (quantized model). If exported, it’s a file that contains the quantized model (which typically is smaller in size than the original). For instance, an INT8 quantized PyTorch model saved might be much smaller file size than the FP32 one. If in ONNX, the ONNX graph will contain int8 quantized nodes. The UI output should inform the user, for example: “Exported quantized INT8 model to model_quant.onnx (reduced size by ~60%).” If measuring exact, could say original vs new size. If not, a general success note.  
       So format wise, one output is a model file (similar formats as before, just quantized internally), and another output is text feedback. If the UI displays performance, it could also output something like "Expected speedup: 2x in CPU inference" as text, but that's extra.  

   - **Task Name:** Deployment Status Tracking  
     - **Detailed Implementation Steps:**  
       1. Create a **DeploymentManager** component that handles deploying the model to a production or runtime environment and tracks the status of that deployment. The specifics of deployment can vary widely (cloud service, local server, edge device, etc.), but we’ll assume a scenario such as launching a server locally or uploading to a server. For this breakdown, consider a simple case: deploying a model means starting an inference server with the model or uploading the model to a remote endpoint.  
       2. Provide a “Deploy Model” button (or it could be combined in the export UI as “Export & Deploy”). When clicked, initiate the deployment process. This might involve:  
          - If deploying locally: running a script or command to start a server that loads the model (for example, starting a FastAPI/Flask server that serves the model). In a development environment, this could be a child process (`python serve_model.py --model path`) started by Node.  
          - If deploying to a cloud service (like AWS Lambda or Hugging Face Model Hub), it might involve using an API or SDK call. For instance, calling AWS CLI to upload a model, or sending an HTTP request to an endpoint that accepts the model file.  
       3. Immediately update the UI to show that deployment has started. For example, set a state `deployStatus = "in_progress"` and perhaps display a progress bar or spinner with text “Deploying model...”. If you have multiple steps (upload, then start, then verify), you could update a sub-status text accordingly.  
       4. Monitor the deployment progress. If this is a local process, you can listen to its output (similar to training). For example, the server might print "Model loaded, serving on port 8000" when ready. The DeploymentManager can capture that and mark deployment as complete. If it’s a remote upload, you might poll an endpoint for status or rely on the promise of an API call completing. In a stubbed scenario, simply use a timeout to simulate time taken.  
       5. On successful completion, update the status to “deployed” and show a success message like “Deployment successful!”. You might also display connection info if relevant (e.g., “Model API available at http://localhost:8000/predict”). If the deployment yields an endpoint URL or ID (like a model version ID on a cloud service), show that.  
       6. Handle failure cases: if the deployment process exits with error or an API returns error, capture that and update the status to “failed”, showing an error message. Possibly allow retry after fixing any issues.  
       7. Keep the user informed during the process: if it’s long, you might show a progress indicator. If you can estimate progress (like uploading file percentage), update that. This could be done by hooking into upload callbacks or by breaking the process into steps (e.g., "Uploading model... 50%").  
       8. Test in Storybook with a simulated deployment. For instance, when clicking the button, simply use a setTimeout to change status after a few seconds. Update a fake log: e.g., after 1 second, set status text to "Model uploaded, starting server...", after 2 seconds "Server running". Then mark done at 3 seconds. This will allow you to verify the UI transitions from "Deploying..." to "Deployed". Also simulate a failure scenario by perhaps having a boolean knob in the story that forces a failure path (so you can see the error message).  
       9. Ensure that this component is integrated with previous steps: it likely needs a model artifact to deploy. If the model must be exported to a particular format before deployment (e.g., ONNX for a Triton server, or a SavedModel for TF Serving), ensure the user either did that or incorporate it: maybe the deploy logic automatically uses the latest exported file. For simplicity, assume deploying the model as it was last exported/saved. So the component might read `globalState.model.latestCheckpoint` or `latestExportedModelPath`. If that’s empty, perhaps it should prompt to export first or automatically call the export routine.  
       10. Additionally, after deployment, if the inference component (5.1) can be pointed to the deployed model (like use the live API instead of local inference), that could be an integration point. But not required in this task—just note that deployment means the model can now be used outside of the development environment.  
     - **Required Data and Storybook.js Component State:**  
       - **Data:** The model artifact to deploy (path to model file or model object). If deploying externally, possibly credentials or endpoint info (not explicitly mentioned, but e.g., an API URL or auth token could be needed). If deploying locally, the path to the model and the script/command to run. Also data such as the target environment (local vs cloud) if multiple options were allowed. For now, assume either a known target or just one method.  
       - **State:**  
         - `deployStatus`: can be `"idle"`, `"in_progress"`, `"success"`, `"failed"`.  
         - `deployMessage` or `deployLog`: text to show the user about current step or error details.  
         - Possibly `endpointURL` (string) for where the model is deployed (if available after success).  
         - If providing a progress percent: `uploadProgress` (number 0-100).  
         - The component might also have state for whether to deploy quantized vs full model, if we integrate with previous selection (for example, if the quantization checkbox is on, maybe deploy the quantized model). This could reuse the same state from 6.2 or global flags.  
       - Global state might store something like `globalState.deployment = { status, url }` if we want other parts of the UI to know that a model is deployed and perhaps allow sending requests to it. But that might be beyond scope.  
     - **Dependencies on Other Tasks:**  
       This depends on having a model ready to deploy, so tasks in section 4 (training) and possibly section 6.1 (export) if the deployment requires a specific format. It also could depend on 6.2 (quantization) if we want the option to deploy an optimized model. For instance, maybe we only want to deploy after quantizing. But it’s not strictly required; one could deploy the FP32 model as well.  
       In terms of implementation, it should be done after those tasks. Also, to test deployment, environment setup (1.1) should include any server tools if needed (for example, if using ONNX Runtime Server or a Flask app, ensure those packages exist). If this is conceptual, not needed to actually run.  
       No direct dependency on inference UI or evaluation, except that logically you deploy after verifying the model.  
     - **Expected Input and Output Formats:**  
       **Input:** The user triggers deployment by clicking the deploy button. Also, input parameters might include which model file to deploy (if the UI allowed choosing a model version or checkpoint, that would be input, but we didn’t explicitly add that option in tasks above; we assume the latest model). If deploying to remote, possibly input like a server URL or project name could be needed (not covered, but could be hidden config). For local, maybe none. So basically, the action itself is the input.  
       Internally, the input to the deployment process is the model file (format depends on server: if we use ONNX runtime server, we give it an ONNX; if a PyTorch server, maybe a .pth or script module). Also any config like port number (could default).  
       **Output:** The output is a running model service or a deployed artifact. In a local scenario, the output is a server listening at some address. In a cloud scenario, output might be an accessible endpoint or a job ID. The UI reflects this output by showing something like “Model deployed at `http://localhost:8000`” or “Model upload complete. Deployment ID: 12345.” Additionally, output includes status transitions: a progress or completion state. If we treat the output in terms of data: the final deployed endpoint (string URL) is a key output. The user-facing output is status messages (text) and possibly a link (if an HTTP endpoint, you might clickable link). If deployment fails, the output is an error message displayed (and no endpoint given).
